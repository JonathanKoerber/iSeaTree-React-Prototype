# iSeaTree-React-Prototype

Prototype for the iSeaTree (a mobile app which creates compatible data collection for the iTree project).

## Development

Project was initialized using [Expo](https://expo.io). Here is a guide how to [get-started with expo](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/get-started/installation).

### Prerequisites

- node v12.16.1
- [yarn v1.19.1](https://yarnpkg.com)
- [expo-cli v3.16](https://www.npmjs.com/package/expo-cli)

### Instalation

From the project's root directory run:

```bash
yarn install
```

### Running

```bash
yarn start
```

### Secrets

`envVariables.ts` file holds all secret keys (api keys etc). It should never be commited to the repo. Before starting the app, get correct values from someone.

```bash
cp envVariables.example.ts envVariables.ts
```

Now you can follow displayed instructioned. For example, you can open Android emulator pressing `a` in the current tab.
